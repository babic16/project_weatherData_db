# project_weatherData_db
Started uploading archive of weather data (Temperature, Humidity  and other info) collected in bunch of notebooks from 2012.
Location of collecting data is: BabiÄ‡i (Doboj Istok, Bosnia & Herzegovina). Lot of work need to be done here to populate this database with all of data. But all stuff about programming and linking php and sql_db is here. So anyone who has same kind of
archive laying in dust could use this as reference how to convert those papers in easy readable online archive.
